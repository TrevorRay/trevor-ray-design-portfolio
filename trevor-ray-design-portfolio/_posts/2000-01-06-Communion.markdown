# Store Auditing Web App

My team and I had the opportunity to redesign and build a store auditing tool. The application helps administrators build audit forms, add stores to be audited, organize their teams, and assign groups of team members to audit stores. The goal was to simplify the process of finding and editing teams, allowing users to seamlessly assign those teams to stores that required an audit. The resulting UI is scannable, scalable, and streamlined - making assigning and editing tasks a simple process.

As the lead designer for the project, I translated functional specs into wireframes and high fidelity UI mockups for key app pages. I also lead UI/UX meetings where my team and I established user flows and determined content hierarchy and user interactions. Throughout the project I worked one on one with the development team to ensure that all requirements were being met, and that final implementation was true to the designs.

## My Teams Page

From the my teams page admins have the ability to add a new team, view all teams associated with their account, and navigate to a teams detail page by clicking on any of the team cards.

## Add a New Team

Campaign leaders can quickly add a new store auditing team via the prominently placed add a new team cell. User interviews informed the team that team leads frequently utilized this functionality so it needed to be easy access and use.

## Team Detail Page

From the team detail page, admins can review their teams progress on completing specific campaigns, prioritize campaigns via the drag-and-drop table, and navigate to a campaign page to make adjustments to campaign details.

## Campaign Builder View

The campaign builder is the core of the store auditing app and houses the majority of its core functionality. The page utilizes drag and drop to make assembling the various sections of a campaign a simple matter of adding elements to a bucket. From the campaign builder page, admins can build forms which are collections of questions store auditors answer about the location they are auditing. Admins also search for locations to be audited via Google maps, choose the location they want to add, and drag it from the store search to the store list column. Finally admins can add new auditors to their teams and assign them to a store to complete an audit.

The linear progression of building sections of a campaign ensures that the admin can always see what stage of the campaign building process they are at. Admins can quickly review the decisions they have made and easily reverse a decision if the need arises. At any point, the admin can edit the details of a campaign which adds to the simplicity and fluidity of the campaign building process.
