# Communion Bakery & Cafe

Communion Bakery & Cafe is a new bakery concept coming to Durham, North Carolina. Communion will start as a series of pop-up shops, with the intent of opening a high-end, late-night dessert bar in a brick-and-mortar location. Working directly with the founder, I developed an identity that reflected Communionâ€™s focus on high quality products and superior ingredients, and appealed to their desired high-end market.
