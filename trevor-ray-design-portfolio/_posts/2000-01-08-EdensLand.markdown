# EdensLand

EdensLand is a fast growing, multidisciplinary civil engineering and land development firm located in Durham, NC. They work on projects ranging from land planning for residential development to infrastructure engineering for municipalities.

Working in collaboration with the EdensLand team, I developed the new EdensLand identity, stationary package, and brand style guide. The "E" mark symbolizes the stability and transparency of EdensLand. The curve at the base of the E both symbolizes the flexibility of the company.

The bright orange symbolizes the forward-thinking, youth, and optimism of EdensLand, while the deep blue symbolizes stability and trustworthiness. In addition to being very visible, the bright orange also helps distinguish EdensLand from their competitors. In an industry filed with blues and grays, the EdensLand orange and deep blue combination helps the company fit into the market while standing out from the crowd.
